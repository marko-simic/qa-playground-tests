# End-to-end tests for the [QAPlayground.dev](https://qaplayground.dev) mini web apps

With the help of a great [Playwright](https://playwright.dev), I managed to solve all the test automation challenges. ðŸ˜‰

## Installing dependencies

How to install dependencies:

```
npm i
```

## Running the project

How to run the tests:

```
npx playwright test
```

How to run the tests with open browser:

```
npx playwright test --headed
```

Or you can run a pre-defined script with the command

```
npm run test
```

or

```
npm run headed
```
